    <h1>First feedback </h1>
    <p>
      I have received feedback from several students and a teacher. 
      What I have heard most is that it is best to create multiple folders so that it is clear. 
      There were also different opinions about the use of color. In the end I think the colors are beautiful 
      and that is of course an opinion. I also had to make it a bit more personal so that you could really 
      see that it was made by me.
