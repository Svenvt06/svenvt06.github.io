    <h1>Personal SWOT analysis</h1>



<details>
  <summary>Strength</summary>
  <p>helpful</p>
  <p>
    I am very helpful and am always willing to help people if I can. This can always be useful in group assignments.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>weakness</summary>
  <p>distracting</p>
  <p>
    I am always quite easily distracted by things happening around me or things I could be doing other than what I am doing. 
    The best thing for me is to be in a space where I can't do much else.
  </p>

<details>
  <summary>oppertunities</summary>
  <p>energy</p>
  <p>
    I think it is a fun study to do and therefore I have enough willpower to complete it 
    and that can be a nice help when I have to do something for school.
  </p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>threats</summary>
  <p>procrastinating</p>
  <p>
    Whenever there is a deadline for something I always do something that is fun to do but that should not be done. 
    This can be quite dangerous if I can't keep up with it all later so it's up to me to prevent that.
