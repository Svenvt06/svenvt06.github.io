      I looked at different types of studies when I was still in high school.
    I found it difficult to choose a nice study because
    I didn't really know what I really liked. At the last moment I decided
    to choose ICT because that seemed the most fun to do 
    something with later, I also find it interesting to know everything about computers.

      I think it would be fun to do something with ICT in the future at the Ministry of Defence. 
      If that doesn't work out, I also think it would be fun to make websites for other companies or to make games.
